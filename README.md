# IPL Data Analysis Using Apache PySpark

A comprehensive data analysis project for Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket data using Apache PySpark. This project demonstrates big data processing techniques, SQL operations, and data visualization for cricket analytics.

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes IPL cricket data from multiple seasons to extract meaningful insights about player performance, team strategies, and match outcomes. Using Apache PySpark's distributed computing capabilities, we process large datasets efficiently and generate actionable insights.

## üèè Dataset Description

The project works with five main datasets:

### 1. Ball_By_Ball.csv
Contains detailed ball-by-ball information for every delivery in IPL matches:
- Match and over details
- Batting and bowling team information
- Runs scored, extras, and wicket information
- Player IDs for striker, non-striker, bowler, and fielders

### 2. Match.csv
Match-level information including:
- Team details (Team1, Team2)
- Match metadata (date, season, venue, city)
- Toss and match winners
- Win margins and match outcomes
- Man of the Match awards

### 3. Player.csv
Player master data:
- Player demographics (name, date of birth)
- Playing style (batting hand, bowling skill)
- Country information

### 4. Player_match.csv
Player-specific match information:
- Role descriptions and team assignments
- Age at match time
- Captain and wicket-keeper flags
- Man of the Match indicators

### 5. Team.csv
Team master data with team IDs and names

## üîß Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Java 8+ (required for PySpark)
- Apache Spark

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdarshRout/IPL-Data-Analysis-Using-Apache-PySpark.git
   cd IPL-Data-Analysis-Using-Apache-PySpark
   ```

2. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install pyspark matplotlib seaborn pandas jupyter
   ```

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the analysis notebook**
   Open `IPL-data-analysis.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially

## üíª Usage

### Running the Analysis

1. **Initialize Spark Session**
   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
   spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('IPL-Analysis').getOrCreate()
   ```

2. **Load Data with Schemas**
   The notebook includes predefined schemas for all datasets ensuring data consistency.

3. **Execute Analysis Queries**
   Run the provided SQL queries to generate insights:
   - Top scoring batsmen analysis
   - Economical bowlers in powerplay
   - Toss impact analysis
   - Venue performance metrics

4. **Generate Visualizations**
   Create charts and graphs using matplotlib and seaborn for better insight presentation.

### Sample Analysis Queries

**Top Batsmen by Season:**
```sql
SELECT p.player_name, m.season_year, SUM(b.runs_scored) AS total_runs
FROM ball_by_ball b
JOIN match m ON b.match_id = m.match_id
JOIN player_match pm ON m.match_id = pm.match_id AND b.striker = pm.player_id
JOIN player p ON p.player_id = pm.player_id
GROUP BY p.player_name, m.season_year
ORDER BY m.season_year, total_runs DESC
```

**Economical Bowlers in Powerplay:**
```sql
SELECT p.player_name, AVG(b.runs_scored) AS avg_runs_per_ball
FROM ball_by_ball b
JOIN player_match pm ON b.match_id = pm.match_id AND b.bowler = pm.player_id
JOIN player p ON pm.player_id = p.player_id
WHERE b.over_id <= 6
GROUP BY p.player_name
ORDER BY avg_runs_per_ball
```

## üìä Sample Visualizations

The project generates several types of visualizations:

1. **Bar Charts**: Most economical bowlers, top scorers
2. **Count Plots**: Toss impact analysis, dismissal type frequency
3. **Horizontal Bar Charts**: Venue-wise scoring analysis

## üéØ Key Findings
